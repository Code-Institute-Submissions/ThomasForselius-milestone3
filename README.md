# What is it?

FriendControl is the first version of the backend player management for my upcoming real world game FriendFeud.
It's a simple python script to crud - create, read, update, delete - players and admins for the game. 

# User Story

To start the game, navigate to this adress: [Heroku Deployment](https://friendfeud-backend.herokuapp.com/)

The application is started automatically when the page loads. 
*To restart the application, click the button "Run Program" at the top*

When starting the game, the user is presented with a menu consisting of 6 menu items:
![Layout](img/start.png)

On each menu item the user is guided through simple steps and is prompted for input when applicable. 

# UX and UI

The program is written to be as clear to read as possible, with line breaks to separate information, colors to group certain objects such as inputs, the main menu and wrong input as well as styling the player and admin lists as tables.

Inputs: Cyan
Main menu: Green
Player tables: white
Wrong input: Red

A key aspect of any user experience is the ease-of-use of a product or application. 
People want quick and easy to use and navigate. Keep the intrest alive!
